# mp3-duration-lambda

Simple Lambda function that pulls a remote MP3 file, returns its duration and removes it again.


## TODO

- [ ] Add Arrays of MP3 files, that returns totalDuration
- [ ] Optimize a bit, node_modules is 10M+. I don't think we need all this shit
  for simple operation
- [ ] Set filesize limit
